The files in this folder directory have all different use cases:

here is a brief summary of the content of the different files:

/common.py
-> blobs try to get food to reproduce

/speed.py
-> genetic inheritance of speed
-> mutations > randomness to make evolution possible
-> round based > click to start next one

/speed_adapted.py
-> same as speed.py
-> food count is count of blobs > more extinction

/2gens.py
-> same as speed.py, but added inheritance of precision
-> display of the count of genes over time after simulation
-> automatically start the next round

/3gens.py
-> same as 2gens.py, but added inheritance of size
-> much smaller blobs are addible

/3gens_adapted.py
-> same as 3gens.py
-> count of children dependent on the count of food the blob ate 

/days.py
-> same as 2gens.py, but overworked simualtion system
-> sexual reproduction instead of duplication
-> No round based simulation
-> less blobs
-> dominant and recessive genes to make simulation more realistic
